# Accessibility principles and guidelines

The latest version of the WCAG is WCAG 2.2, which defines some guidelines for covering accessibility on mobile devices. Still, it does not cover how to natively satisfy those guidelines on modern platforms like Android and iOS.

Because of that, we defined our guidelines to help mobile developers to satisfy most of the guidelines defined by WCAG.

In the following chapters, information about satisfying accessibility guidelines will be provided with descriptions and techniques:

* [Perceivable guidelines](principles/perceivable_principle.md)
* [Operable guidelines](principles/operable_principle.md)
* [Understandable guidelines](principles/understandable_principle.md)
* [Robust guidelines](principles/robust_principle.md)

Alongside the guidelines and examples, you can check the list of requirements that should be satisfied for each guideline:

* [Accessibility checklist](accessibility_checklist.md)
