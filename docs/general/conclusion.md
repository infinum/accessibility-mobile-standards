# Conclusion

As mentioned in the introduction, making applications that are accessible to everyone defines us as well - our values and priorities.

Every person should be able to use our applications, and these mobile standards are here to help us with that. Making even small changes to make applications more open to a broad audience is a step forward.

Accessibility mobile standards cover the WCAG standard related to mobile implementation and its usage on native applications on mobile devices.

This document is and will be in active development, with care in our mind to make it better with every update. Of course, everyone is invited to contribute to these mobile standards and improve them.
