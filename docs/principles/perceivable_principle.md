# 1. Perceivable principle

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

## 1.1 Text alternatives

Provide text alternatives for any non-text content to be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or more straightforward language.

### 1.1.1 Non-text content (Level A)

When talking about the screen elements, it is important to make information about all elements accessible and available. Some elements may not have text included by design or as a default user interface component. This can be seen when buttons are used with icons only, images, or other decorative elements.

Some users may have issues identifying an element's functionality or description in general, and because of that, it is important to define non-text elements by accessibility features.

> This guideline with provided techniques covers the *1.1.1 Non-text Content - Level A of the WCAG standard.*

## 1.2 Time-based Media

Provide alternatives for time-based media.

### 1.2.1-1.2.2 Captions support for prerecorded media (Level A)

Due to some disabilities, some users may not be able to hear the content of the media provided by the application. An example of that can be a prerecorded audio or video track. In some cases, it is necessary to add support for some accessibility features to make this content accessible to all users.
