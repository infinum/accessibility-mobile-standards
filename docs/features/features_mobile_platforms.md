# Accessibility features per mobile platform

Mobile standards provide information about accessibility features and implementation for the following platforms:

* Android
* [iOS](features_ios.md "Accessibility features on iOS")
* [Flutter](features_flutter.md "Accessibility features in Flutter")

Even those platforms are a bit different; the main idea is to provide the same experience to our mobile apps on all platforms. The following paragraphs provide detailed information about accessibility features per supported platforms.
