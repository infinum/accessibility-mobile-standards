* [Android](android/features_android.md)
* [Flutter](flutter/features_flutter.md)
* [iOS](ios/features_ios.md)


Even though those platforms are different, the main idea is to provide the same experience to our mobile apps on all platforms. The following paragraphs provide detailed information about accessibility features per supported platforms.
