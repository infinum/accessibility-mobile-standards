## [3.1 Readable](../../principles/understandable_principle.md#31-readable)

### [3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A)](../../principles/understandable_principle.md#311-language-of-page-level-a)

#### âœ… Success technique(s)

If the app supports multiple languages, we should also care that accessibility labels are localized as well.

You should use `LocalizationsDelegate` in the MaterialApp and all labels in the widget should use the delegate instead of being hardcoded. Same rule applies to labels inside `Semantics` widgets.

If the label is not known at the runtime, e.g. if it's coming from HTTP request, then response of that request should be localized in a way where app sends the language as a header:
```
Accept-Language: de-DE
```

and the labels are returned localized in selected language so they can be shown to the user.

#### ðŸš« Failures

Hard-coding a language code and labels inside an app should be avoided.

Also, every app should be developed as a localizable app, even if it seems like it makes no sense at the start, or all of the intended audience speak a single language, it can still happen that some users will not be able to use that language and there is always a possibility that your app will scale to different language regions or that parts of your code will be reused on different projects which _do_ use localization.

## [3.2 Predictable](../../principles/understandable_principle.md#32-predictable)

### [3.2.1-3.2.2 On Focus & On Input (Level A)](../../principles/understandable_principle.md#321-322-on-focus--on-input-level-a)

#### âœ… Success technique(s)

Users need to be able to consume content without any sudden interruptions and/or changes of context. Receiving focus on or interacting with any component should not initiate a change of context unless previously announced. By change of context we mean major changes in the content of the screen.

Interacting with any UI component doesn't automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been previously advised of the behavior _before_ using the component.

Changes of focus and thus context should only ever be done intentionally and consciously.

#### ðŸš« Failures

Showing programmatically pre-planned popups, modals, or any unusual navigation not directly initiated by the user is considered a change of context.

```dart

  void onUserEnteredScreen() {
    await Future(() {}, duration: Duration(seconds: 10));
    showAdDialog();
  }
```

- A form is submitted automatically when a certain UI element receives focus.
- Focus is automatically moved to a different UI element when a give UI receives focus.

## [3.3 Input Assistance](../../principles/understandable_principle.md#33-input-assistance)

### [3.3.1 Error Identification (Level A)](../../principles/understandable_principle.md#331-error-identification-level-a)

#### âœ… Success technique(s)

If a form contains fields for which information from the user is mandatory the app should provide text descriptions to help identify those fields which are not sufficiently filled-out. The app should be able to validate and present a human-understandable error to the user even without needing to reach a remote endpoint.

```dart
TextField(
    errorText: hasError ? errorLabel : null
)
// or
TextFormField(
    validator: (value) {
        if (value.length < 4) {
            return AppString.shortName;
        }
        return null;
    },
)
```

#### ðŸš« Failures

Preventing some action or flow from continuing because an error was detected but not communicating to the user how/when the error was made and/or what needs to be done to correct it.

### [3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)](../../principles/understandable_principle.md#332-labels-or-instructions-level-a)

#### âœ… Success technique(s)

Descriptive labels should be applied to user interface elements, especially those that the user is expected to interact with.

```dart
TextField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(hintText: 'Username'),
)
```

It's a good practice that fields that expect entering input in some format, contains initial text which indicates the correct format. For example:

```dart
Column(children: [
    Text('Enter code:'),
    TextField(
        decoration: InputDecoration(hintText: 'ABC-445'),
    ),
])
```
#### ðŸš« Failures

User enters some data into a user interface element without knowing what the end result is and/or triggering an unannounced change of context in the process.
