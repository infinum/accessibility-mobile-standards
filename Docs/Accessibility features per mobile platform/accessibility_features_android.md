# Android accessibility features overview

Accessibility is very important part of any app and it should be considered during whole development process. If properly implemented, accessibility features and services can significantly improve your app's usability especially for users with disabilities, but also in general. In this chapter we are going to introduce available Android accessibility features. 

## TalkBack

The TalkBack is the Google screen reader available on Android devices that allows you to control your app eyes-free. 

### Navigate your device with TalkBack 

When you [turn on TalkBack on your android device](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6007100), you will be able to explore your app using touches and swipes. 

#### Explore the app by touch

As you slowly drag one finger around the screen, TalkBack announces icons, buttons, and other elements present on the screen. Also, after the pause, TalkBack might suggest actions for you, like how to activate or view the content. When you find an item you want, double-tap anywhere on the screen to select it.

#### Explore the app by swipe 

To explore your screen one item at a time, swipe up or down with one finger. When you focus on an item, TalkBack reads that item aloud and might suggest actions for you.

Detailed description of all TalkBack configuration could be found on official [Android Accessibility Help page](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6006598?hl=en&ref_topic=10601571).
