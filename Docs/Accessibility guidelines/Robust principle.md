# Robust principle

This principle describes that the content of the application should be robust enough to be interpreted by the user but also by different user agents, including assistive technologies.

To be more precise, we can interpret it as; the application should be compatible with the assistive technology that is available on the platform which the user uses.

## Aspects

### Compatible

The compatible is the only aspect defined by this principle, and it describes how to maximize the compatibility with the current platform and assistive technologies on it. Also, it defines that all components should be programmatically determined - their name, role, and value.
