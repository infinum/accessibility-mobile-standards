# Operable

Users with disabilities should be able to use the app.

## Keyboard Accessible

The app should be fully functional for users whose only input device is the keyboard. Operating via the keyboard should be concise and possible without requiring specific timing for individual keystrokes. Navigating into and out of different parts of the app should be possible without getting stuck. Document unconventional keyboard navigation methods. For keyboard shortcuts that only require pressing a single letter or number, the user should be able to turn the shortcut off or remap it.

## Enough Time

Some users might have trouble grasping and interacting with the content that is available only for a limited time or is auto-updating. If possible, there should be a way to extend, pause or disable the timing.

## Seizures and Physical Reactions

For some users, excessive flashing might cause seizures. As a general rule, avoid content that flashes more than three times in any one second period.

## Navigable

The app's navigation structure should be concise and easy to understand. Users should have an indication of where they are located and how their actions will affect their location. There should be a way to bypass content that is repeated on multiple screens. The focus order should be clear and predictable.

# Input Modalities

Some users might have trouble moving the device, themselves or performing complex gestures. Strive for the app to be operable using a variety of input methods. If possible, the user should have a way to undo the interaction and disable the input methods he might trigger accidentally.
